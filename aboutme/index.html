    <h2>Ryan Jensen</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone. I am Ryan Jensen. I was born in American Fork Utah and lived in Pleasant Grove Utah for about 11 years. I then moved
        to Wellington, Florida where I still currently live. I do live in Rexburg for school though. Much prefer the Rexburg Winters to the Florida
        Summers. </p>
    <p>I love computers, inside and out. I love to play video games any chance I get. Some of my favorites being Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, SMITE, League of Legends, and Destiny 2.
        I also listen to way too much music. I love any music (except for classical and country) but prefer classic rock and any music from the late 60's to around the 2010's
        I'm also a sucker for movies, my favorite being Pacific Rim.</p>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science and going into my 3rd semester here at BYU-I. However after this semester, I will be transferring to an online school
        and will be staying in Florida to finish my degree rather than going back and forth and having to put a pause on work every few months (Trying to get a car).</p>
    <p>I look forward to working with all of you and getting to know you better. Everyone have a great semester.</p>
