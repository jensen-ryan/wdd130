                <h3>Welcome to Ryanâ€™s Reviews.</h3>
                <p>Here I will be letting everyone know my thoughts on a few of my favorite games, as well as how long I have played each game. I love to play games a lot, and I hope that my opinions and information help some of you understand how some of these games work and maybe even help you decide on a game to try out.

                <h4>Why do I play games?</h4>
                <p>I play games because it is an escape from the world and it gives me a time to relax 
                    <br>and have fun with my friends. It also gives me a chance to give my mind a challenge and
                    <br>practice problem-solving and teamwork.
