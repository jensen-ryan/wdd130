        Welcome to Ryanâ€™s Reviews. Here I will be letting everyone know my thoughts on a few of my favorite games, as well as how long I have played each game. I love to play games a lot, and I hope that my opinions and information help some of you understand how some of these games work and maybe even help you decide on a game to try out.
